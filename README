An example program, using mprotect call to change rights on memory, writes some opcodes and launches them.

	void* mapWritableMemory(int length, void** deleteptr)
		Method creates about 8192 + length bytes memory, changes access rights to +rwx on length of them.
		Arguments:
			length - count bytes to prepare
			deleteptr - pointer to voidptr, receives address of the whole mapped memory area (not only executable area) or NULL on error
		Return value:
			address of the first of length bytes of executable memory or NULL on error
		
		Mapped memory must be free()-d by hand, using deleteptr, not return value!

It was a very interesting theme for me, but I didn't find anything like that, so I had to do that by hands.
